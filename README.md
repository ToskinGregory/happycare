The food supply chain is a vital network that ensures the production, distribution, and availability of food worldwide, supporting both sustainability and food security. As the supply chain has expanded geographically and involved more stakeholders, it has become longer and more complex, introducing several challenges.

Common challenges in food supply chains include:

Limited traceability and communication: Difficulty tracking food products across the supply chain can lead to delays and hinder timely responses to issues such as contamination or recalls.
Rising costs: Transportation, storage, and operational expenses continue to increase, impacting the affordability and efficiency of food distribution.
Fraudulent food products: The presence of counterfeit or adulterated foods threatens consumer safety resulting to rise in non communicable diseases and undermines trust in the supply chain.
Inadequate warehouse monitoring: Poor oversight of storage facilities can cause spoilage, wastage, and reduced food quality, particularly for perishable items.
Project Objectives To address these challenges, this project aims to develop a decentralized food supply chain system that enables end-to-end traceability of food products while providing customers with accurate and reliable information.

Key Features

Global traceability: Track food products throughout the entire supply chain, from production to consumption.
Authentication and fraud prevention: Detect and prevent duplicate or unauthentic products from entering the market.
Efficient distribution: Optimize the movement of food products to ensure timely and proper delivery.
Cost reduction: Minimize supply chain expenses through improved transparency and streamlined operations.
By leveraging decentralization and smart technologies, the system aims to create a transparent, efficient, and trustworthy food supply chain that benefits both stakeholders and consumers.
